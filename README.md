# Marlowe-Contracts

Here you will find a collection of my Marlowe Smart Contracts. Hopefully, some of them will inspire ideas and innovation in others!


Here is a crowdfunding contract that gives 4 addresses a choice to send between 1 and 1000000000 Lovelace to the smart contract. If the total Lovelace is not greater than or equal to 40000000 by the set deadline, the smart contract will automatically refund all addresses the Lovelace amount they contributed:
